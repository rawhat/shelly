- support default template, local fs directory, or github repo

- for the default template, maybe write to a temp directory and then copy it over?
  - maybe also write the hashed config for the language to the build dir
    for easier diffing later
  - might want to add a flag for like... `--no-cache` oslt to be a good citizen
